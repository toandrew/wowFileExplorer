ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* MiuiFileManager.apk
* icon.png
* icon_90.png
* my_keystore
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/AndroidAnalyticSDK3.1.1.jar => app/libs/AndroidAnalyticSDK3.1.1.jar
* libs/Baidu_MobAds_SDK_Wall.jar => app/libs/Baidu_MobAds_SDK_Wall.jar
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => app/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* libs/yjfsdk_10.jar => app/libs/yjfsdk_10.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
